## Kubernetes Architecture

### Kubernetes Components

In previous section we saw that Kubernetes is an orchestration service that simplifies the
deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications. One of the main advantages
of using Kubernetes is that it uses several nodes to ensure the resiliency and scalability of its
managed applications. Kubernetes forms a cluster of node servers that run containers and are
centrally managed by a set of master servers. A server can act as both a server and a node, but
those roles are usually segregated for increased stability.

|===
|TERM
|DEFINITION

|Node
|A server that hosts applications in a Kubernetes cluster.

|Master Node
|A node server that manages the *control plane* in a Kubernetes cluster.
Master nodes provide basic cluster services such as APIs or controllers.

|Worker Node
|Also named *Compute Node*, worker nodes execute workloads for the cluster.
Application *Pods* are scheduled onto worker nodes.

|Resource
|Resources are any kind of component definition managed by Kubernetes.
Resources contain the configuration of the managed component (for
example, the role assigned to a node), and the current state of the
component (for example, if the node is available).

|Control Plane
|The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster.
In production environments, the control plane usually runs across multiple 
computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing 
fault-tolerance and high availability.

|Label
|A key-value pair that can be assigned to any Kubernetes resource. Selectors
use labels to filter eligible resources for scheduling and other operations.

|Namespace
|A scope for Kubernetes resources and processes, so that resources with the
same name can be used in different boundaries.

#### Control Plane Components

The control plane's components make decisions about the cluster; for example,
schedulling, as well as detecting, and responding to cluster events.

Control plane components can be run on any machine in the cluster. 
However, for simplicity, set up scripts typically start all control plane 
components on the same machine, and do not run user containers on this machine.

[cols="20,80",options="header"]
|===
|COMPONENT
|PURPOSE

|kube-apiserver
|The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the 
Kubernetes API. The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.

|etcd
|Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store 
for all cluster data.

|kube-scheduler
|Control plane component that watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node,
and selects a node for them to run on.

|kube-controller-manager
|Control Plane component that runs controller processes. A controller is a Kubernetes 
process that watches resources and makes changes attempting to move the current state 
towards the desired state.

|cloud-controller-manager
|The cloud controller manager lets you link your cluster into your cloud provider's API.
The cloud-controller-manager only runs controllers that are specific to your cloud provider.
If you are running Kubernetes on your own premises, or in a learning environment inside 
your own PC, the cluster does not have a cloud controller manager.

#### Node Components

Node components run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes 
runtime environment.

|COMPONENT
|PURPOSE

|kubelet
|It ensures that containers are running in a Pod. The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs 
and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy.

|kube-proxy
|It is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster. kube-proxy uses the 
operating system packet filtering layer to allow network communication to your Pods.

|Container runtime
|The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers.
Kubernetes supports several container runtimes: *Docker*, *containerd*, *CRI-O*.
|===

#### Kubernetes Dashboard

Kubernetes dashboard is a web UI for managing Kubernetes cluster.
It allows users to manage and troubleshoot applications running in the cluster, 
as well as the cluster itself.

#### Kubernetes CLI

The `kubectl` command line tool lets you control Kubernetes clusters. 
Use the following syntax to run kubectl commands from your terminal window:
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl [command] [TYPE] [NAME] [flags]
----
where,
* `command`: Specifies the operation that you want to perform on one or more resources, 
  for example _create_, _get_, _describe_, _delete_.
* `TYPE`: Specifies the resource type.
* `NAME`: Specifies the name of the resource.

For example, to get nodes in a Kubernetes cluster:
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME          STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
kube-master   Ready    master   90d   v1.18.5
kube-node1    Ready    <none>   90d   v1.18.5
kube-node2    Ready    <none>   90d   v1.18.5
----
For configuration, `kubectl` looks for a file named config in the `$HOME/.kube` directory.
For installation instructions see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[installing kubectl].

### Kubernetes Resource Types

Kubernetes has six main resource types that can be created and configured using a YAML or a
JSON file:

Pods(*po*)::
Represent a collection of containers that share resources, such as IP addresses and persistent
storage volumes. It is the basic unit of work for Kubernetes.

Services(*svc*)::
Define a single IP/port combination that provides access to a pool of pods. By default,
services connect clients to pods in a round-robin fashion.

Replication Controllers(*rc*)::
A Kubernetes resource that defines how pods are replicated (horizontally scaled) into
different nodes. Replication controllers are a basic Kubernetes service to provide high
availability for pods and containers.

Persistent Volumes(*pv*)::
Define storage areas to be used by Kubernetes pods.

Persistent Volume Claims(*pvc*)::
Represent a request for storage by a pod. PVCs links a PV to a pod so its containers can make
use of it, usually by mounting the storage into the container's file system.

ConfigMaps(*cm*) and Secrets::
Contains a set of keys and values that can be used by other resources. ConfigMaps and
Secrets are usually used to centralize configuration values used by several resources. Secrets
differ from ConfigMaps maps in that Secrets' values are always encoded (not encrypted) and
their access is restricted to fewer authorized users.

TIP: The `kubectl api-resources` list all the resource types supported by Kubernetes.
