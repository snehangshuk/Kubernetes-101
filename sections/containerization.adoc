## Containerizing an Application

In this section you will take some source code, verify it runs locally, and then create a Docker image of the application. 
The sample application used is a very simple Flask web application; if you want to test it locally, you will need Python installed. 
Otherwise, you can skip to the "Create a Dockerfile" section.

### Get the application code

. Use `git` to clone the repository to your local machine:
+  
[source,bash,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/<TBD>
----
. Change to the app directory:
+  
[source,bash,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ cd hello-python/app
----
. View the `app.py` which the main file that print out a hello message.
+
[source,python,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello from Python!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
----
+
The `requirements.txt` file contains the list of packages needed by the `app.py` and will be used by pip to install the Flask library.

### Run the app locally

. Use `virtualenv` (or `pyenv`) to install your dependencies in a virtual environment.
+  
[source,bash,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ cd venv
$ source bin/activate
<venv>$
----
. Now install the dependencies required by the Python app.
+  
[source,bash,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
<venv>$ pip install -r requirements.txt
----
. Run the Python app locally:
+  
[source,bash,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
<venv>$ python app.py
----
+
This will start a development web server hosting your application, which you will be able to see by navigating to http://localhost:5000. Because port 5000 is the default port for the development server, we did not need to specify it.
+
Deactivate the virtual environment after you have tested locally.
[source,bash,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
<venv>$ deactivate
----

### Create a Docker container image

#### Create a Dockerfile

Now that you have verified the source code works, the first step in containerizing the application is to create a `Dockerfile`.

In the `hello-python/app` directory, create a file named Dockerfile with the following contents and save it:
[source,bash,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
FROM python:3.8 <1>

RUN mkdir /app <2>
WORKDIR /app <3>
ADD . /app/ <4>
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt <5>

EXPOSE 5000 <6>
CMD ["python", "/app/app.py"] <7>
----
<1> Get Python base image for version 3.8 from Docker Hub
<2> Inside the image, create a directory named app
<3> Set the working directory to that new app directory
<4> Copy the local directory's contents to that new folder into the image
<5> Run the pip installer to pull the requirements into the image
<6> Open the container port on 5000 to listen for requests
<7> Execute the command `python /app/app.py` when container starts

#### Create the Docker image

At your command line or shell, in the `hello-python/app` directory, build the image with the following command:
[source,bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ docker build -f Dockerfile -t hello-python:latest .
----
To verify the image was created, run the following command:
[source,bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ docker image ls
----
Before uploading the image to Docker Hub, verify it works in Docker.
Run the following command to have Docker run the application in a container and map it to port 5001:
[source,bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ docker run -p 5001:5000 hello-python
----
Now navigate to link:http://localhost:5001[http://localhost:5001], and you should see the `Hello form Python!` message.

#### Publish image to Docker Hub

For uploading our image to Docker Hub, you first need to create a repository. 
To create a repo:

. Sign up for link:https://hub.docker.com/signup[Docker Hub]
. Click on btn:[Create a Repository] on the Docker Hub welcome page
. Name it `<your-username>/my-first-repo` as shown below. Select Public:
+
image::images/create-repo.png[Docker-create-repo,float="center",align="center"]
After you have created your repo. You should see:
+
image::images/repo.png[Docker-repo,float="center",align="center"]
