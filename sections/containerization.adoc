## Containerizing an Application

In this section you will take some source code, verify it runs locally, and then create a Docker image of the application. 
The sample application used is a very simple Flask web application; if you want to test it locally, you will need Python installed. 
Otherwise, you can skip to the "Create a Dockerfile" section.

### Get the application code

. Use `git` to clone the repository to your local machine:
+  
[source,bash,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/snehangshuk/hello-python.git
----
. Change to the app directory:
+  
[source,bash,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ cd hello-python/src
----
. View the `app.py` which the main file that print out a hello message.
+
[source,python,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello from Python!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
----
+
The `requirements.txt` file contains the list of packages needed by the `app.py` and will be used by `pip` to install the Flask library.

### Run the app locally

. Use `virtualenv` (or `pyenv`) to install your dependencies in a virtual environment.
+  
[source,bash,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
<venv>$
----
. Now install the dependencies required by the Python app.
+  
[source,bash,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
<venv>$ pip install -r requirements.txt
----
. Run the Python app locally:
+  
[source,bash,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
<venv>$ python app.py
----
+
This will start a development web server hosting your application, which you will be able to see by navigating to http://localhost:5000. Because port 5000 is the default port for the development server, we did not need to specify it.
+
Deactivate the virtual environment after you have tested locally.
[source,bash,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
<venv>$ deactivate
----

### Create a Docker container image

#### Create a Dockerfile

Now that you have verified the source code works, the first step in containerizing the application is to create a `Dockerfile`.

In the `hello-python/src` directory, create a file named Dockerfile with the following contents and save it:
[source,bash]
----
FROM python:3.8 # <1>

RUN mkdir /app # <2>
WORKDIR /app # <3>
ADD . /app/ # <4>
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt # <5>

EXPOSE 5000 # <6>
CMD ["python", "/app/app.py"] # <7>
----
<1> Get Python base image for version 3.8 from Docker Hub
<2> Inside the image, create a directory named app
<3> Set the working directory to that new app directory
<4> Copy the local directory's contents to that new folder into the image
<5> Run the pip installer to pull the requirements into the image
<6> Open the container port on 5000 to listen for requests
<7> Execute the command `python /app/app.py` when container starts

#### Create the Docker image

At your command line or shell, in the `hello-python/src` directory, build the image with the following command:
[source,bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ docker build -f Dockerfile -t hello-python:latest .
----
To verify the image was created, run the following command:
[source,bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ docker image ls
----
Before uploading the image to Docker Hub, verify it works in Docker.
Run the following command to have Docker run the application in a container and map it to port 5001:
[source,bash, subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ docker run -p 5001:5000 hello-python
----
Now navigate to link:http://localhost:5001[http://localhost:5001], and you should see the `Hello form Python!` message.

#### Publish image to Docker Hub

For uploading our image to Docker Hub, you first need to create a repository. 
To create a repo:

. Sign up for link:https://hub.docker.com/signup[Docker Hub]
. Click on btn:[Create a Repository] on the Docker Hub welcome page
. Name it `<your-username>/hello-python` as shown below. Select btn:[Public]:
+
image::images/create-repo.png[Docker-create-repo,float="center",align="center"]
After you have created your repo. You should see:
+
image::images/repo.png[Docker-repo,float="center",align="center"]
. Using a terminal, sign in to Docker Hub by executing the `docker login` command.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker login
----
. Docker follows the naming convention to identify unofficial images. The image you are creating is an unofficial image. Hence, it should follow that syntax. According to that naming convention, the unofficial image name should be named as follows: `<username>/<image_name>:<tag_name>`. Use the following command to tag the image.
+
[source, bash]
----
$ docker tag hello-python:latest <your-username>/hello-python:latest
----
. Upload your tagged image to the repository using the `docker push` command.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker push <your-username>/hello-python:latest
The push refers to repository [docker.io/<your-username>/hello-python]
The push refers to repository [docker.io/snehangshuk/hello-python]

In Docker Hub, your repository should have a new `latest` tag available under Tags:
