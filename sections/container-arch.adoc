### Introducing Container History

Containers have quickly gained popularity in recent years. However, the technology behind
containers has been around for a relatively long time. In 2001, Linux introduced a project named
VServer. VServer was the first attempt at running complete sets of processes inside a single server
with a high degree of isolation.

From VServer, the idea of isolated processes further evolved and became formalized around the
following features of the Linux kernel:

Namespaces::
The kernel can isolate specific system resources, usually visible to all processes, by placing
the resources within a namespace. Inside a namespace, only processes that are members of
that namespace can see those resources. Namespaces can include resources like network
interfaces, the process ID list, mount points, IPC resources, and the system's host name
information.
Control groups (cgroups)::
Control groups partition sets of processes and their children into groups to manage and
limit the resources they consume. Control groups place restrictions on the amount of system
resources processes might use. Those restrictions keep one process from using too many
resources on the host.
Seccomp::
Developed in 2005 and introduced to containers circa 2014, Seccomp limits how processes
could use system calls. Seccomp defines a security profile for processes, whitelisting the
system calls, parameters and file descriptors they are allowed to use.

All of these innovations and features focus around a basic concept: enabling processes to run
isolated while still accessing system resources. This concept is the foundation of container
technology and the basis for all container implementations. Nowadays, containers are processes
in Linux kernel making use of those security features to create an isolated environment. This
environment forbids isolated processes from misusing system or other container resources.

A common use case of containers is having several replicas for the same service (for example,
a database server) in the same host. Each replica has isolated resources (file system, ports,
memory), so no need for the service to handle resource sharing. Isolation guarantees that a
malfunctioning or harmful service does not impact other services or containers in the same host,
nor in the underlying system.

### Container Architecture

From the Linux kernel perspective, a container is a process with restrictions. However, instead
of running a single binary file, a container runs an _image_. An image is a file-system bundle that
contains all dependencies required to execute a process: files in the file system, installed packages,
available resources, running processes, and kernel modules.

Running containers use an immutable view of the image, allowing multiple
containers to reuse the same image simultaneously. As images are files, they can be managed by
versioning systems, improving automation on container and image provisioning.

Container images need to be _locally_ available for the container runtime to execute them, but the
images are usually stored and maintained in an _*image repository*_. An image repository is just a
service - _public_ or _private_ - where images can be stored, searched and retrieved. Other features
provided by image repositories are remote access, image metadata, authorization or image version
control.

There are many different image repositories available, each one offering different features:

* https://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub]
* https://quay.io/[Red Hat Quay]
* https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/[Google Container Registry]
* https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/[Amazon Elastic Container Registry]

### Managing Containers with Docker

Containers, images, and image registries need to be able to interact with each other. For example,
you need to be able to build images and put them into image registries. You also need to be able
to retrieve an image from the image registry and build a container from that image.

*Docker* is an tool for managing containers and container images and interacting with image registries.
