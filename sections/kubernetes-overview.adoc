## Overview of Kubernetes and AKS

### Limitations of Containers

Containers provide an easy way to package and run services. As the number of containers
managed by an organization grows, the work of manually starting them rises exponentially along
with the need to quickly respond to external demands.

When using containers in a production environment, enterprises often require:

* Easy communication between a large number of services.
* Resource limits on applications regardless of the number of containers running them.
* Respond to application usage spikes to increase or decrease running containers.
* React to service deterioration.
* Gradually roll out a new release to a set of users.

Enterprises often require a container orchestration technology because container runtimes (such
as `Docker`) do not adequately address the above requirements.

### Kubernetes Overview

Kubernetes is an orchestration service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of
containerized applications. A Kubernetes application is an application that is both deployed on 
Kubernetes and managed using the Kubernetes APIs and `kubectl` tooling.

The smallest unit manageable in Kubernetes is a pod. A pod consists of one or more containers
with its storage resources and IP that represent a single application. Kubernetes also uses pods to
orchestrate the containers inside it and to limit its resources as a single unit.

### Kubernetes Features

Kubernetes offers the following features on top of a container infrastructure:

Service discovery and load balancing::
Kubernetes enables inter-service communication by assigning a single DNS entry to each set
of containers. This way, the requesting service only needs to know the target's DNS name,
allowing the cluster to change the container's location and IP address, leaving the service
unaffected. This permits load-balancing the request across the pool of containers providing
the service. For example, Kubernetes can evenly split incoming requests to a MySQL service
taking into account the availability of the pods.
Horizontal scaling::
Applications can scale up and down manually or automatically with configuration set either
with the Kubernetes command-line interface or the web UI.
Self-healing::
Kubernetes can use user-defined health checks to monitor containers to restart and
reschedule them in case of failure.
Automated rollout::
Kubernetes can gradually roll updates out to your application's containers while checking their
status. If something goes wrong during the rollout, Kubernetes can roll back to the previous
iteration of the deployment.
Secrets and configuration management::
You can manage configuration settings and secrets of your applications without rebuilding
containers. Application secrets can be user names, passwords, and service endpoints; any
configuration settings that need to be kept private.
Operators::
Operators is a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes application. You can 
find ready-made operators on link:https://operatorhub.io/[OperatorHub.io] to suit your use case.

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS) is a managed Kubernetes offering that further simplifies 
container-based application deployment and management. AKS reduces the complexity and operational 
overhead of managing Kubernetes by offloading much of that responsibility to Azure. 
As a hosted Kubernetes service, Azure handles critical tasks like health monitoring and maintenance for you.

The Kubernetes masters are managed by Azure. You only manage and maintain the agent nodes. 
As a managed Kubernetes service, AKS is free - you only pay for the agent nodes within your clusters, 
not for the masters.
